# Capitains Repositorium f√ºr Galen

* Follows the guidelines given here: http://capitains.org/pages/guidelines
* Oriented on this example of Galen _De Locis Affectus_ from Perseus: https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin/First1KGreek/blob/master/data/tlg0057/tlg057/tlg0057.tlg057.1st1K-grc1.xml 

Open Questions:
* How do we identify the Author and Title, and Book for the description?
		* Galen is under milestone n=1 in the translation
		* The title and book are under milestone n=2 and n=3 in all files
* Is it possible to have one file per book, or do we need to follow the Persues Galen example of one file for all books?
